When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

--When collaborating with others. Also, to access the work from other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

--Because I want to be in control of the changes that are being pulled as the local branch contains the active development changes.  So, to not disturb the local changes it is better if I pull the changes once I commit the changes locally.  This way, whenever I pull from the remote, if there are any merge conflicts I will be resolving them such that the local changes are in tact.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

--Fork: Cloning repositories within GitHub
  Clones: Clone a repository from remote to local and start collaborating
  Branches: Locally branch repository to parallely work on different features
